# Knowledge Capture

After resolving difficult bugs or implementing complex features:

1. **Identify**: Did we solve something undocumented? Invent a repeatable pattern?
2. **Check**: List `.cursor/skills` for existing skills to update.
3. **Update/Create**: Edit SKILL.md or create new skill under `.cursor/skills/<name>/`.
4. **Workflows**: If the solution involved a sequence, create `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`.
5. **Document**: Update task.md or walkthrough.md with changes.
